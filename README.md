# 🧠 Building Your Own Web Server — Educational Repository

Welcome to the companion repository for the **“Building Your Own Web Server”** article series — a practical and educational journey through the low-level foundations of web server development.

This repository contains fully working, educational Python implementations of:
- ✅ HTTP message parser
- ⚙️ NGINX-inspired configuration parser
- 🔁 Blocking server with keep-alive support
- 🧵 Multithreaded server with route-based config support

Each part is implemented to match the step-by-step explanations in the articles below.

   Dive into building reusable, tested components: an HTTP request parser and a configuration loader inspired by NGINX.

3. [**Building Your Own Web Server — Part 3: Blocking Single and Multithreaded Server**](https://dev.to/dmytro_huz/building-your-own-web-server-part-3-blocking-single-and-multithreaded-server-3h7i)  
   Implement, benchmark, and analyze multiple versions of TCP servers — including a multithreaded server with NGINX-style route matching.



## ✨ Educational Focus

This is not production-ready code — and that's intentional.  
The goal is **understanding**, not abstraction. You’ll find:
- 🧱 Modular building blocks
- 🧪 Clear testable units
- 💬 Well-commented Python code
- 📈 Real-world benchmarking with ApacheBench
